### Volume 1 piece - The Cape by J.R. Carpenter, 2005
This piece combines the written poetry with government-created images. It opens with a grid contents-page, and upon hover of each image a poetic caption appears. Each image is also a hyperlink, which takes the reader to each page. It appears like a simple storybook, but contains certain other digital elements, such as the screen We only ever went to visit her once, in which a second image moves in front of a larger one, creating the illusion of zooming into the larger one with a magnifying glass. Another screen also contains a radio recording. 

Overall I found the experience of this fictional story quite nostalgic and moving, in no small part due to the sensory addition of its digital elements.

### Volume 2 piece - Entre Ville by J.R. Carpenter, 2006 
This is another work by Carpenter. It similarly utilises imagery and sound. It is navigated through hyperlinks, but in a much more complex way to the last work, and in a way which I found fascinating. It presents the page of a diary, with a scrolling, written poem. The rest of the page features various images which can alter upon hover and act as hyperlinks—they open new windows, as if zooming in on that feature in a way, and download a relevant audio file with sound effects to your computer.

### Volume 3 piece - First Draft of the Revolution by Emily Short and Liza Daly, 2012
It took me some time to figure out how this text worked, with the hyperlinks and the whole concept of rewriting the letters, but once I did, I found the whole experience of this text very interesting. Through the experience of umming and ahhing over rewrites, it showed the characters and their relationships in a way that felt intuitive. Whether it was intended or not, I also found the fantasy element of the letters being transported instantly to be ironic against the constant rewriting, because I assumed that the person at the other end would be able to read different edits in real time. I guess the story, despite being text based, benefits from the digital form due to how it could symbolise the instantaneity of digital messaging.

### Volume 4 piece - The Gathering Cloud by J.R. Carpenter, 2016
Yet another piece by Carpenter. I found the environmental angle fascinating—where is this digital internet cloud actually being stored? At first glance, the piece looks as if it could be replicated physically, only consisting of written words and collage images; however, the longer you stay on a page, the more digital nuances you notice, such as animations, and images which only appear on the page after a certain amount of time. Seeing as the piece is digital, and stored in the cloud itself, there is also an additional layer of irony that this is now a necessary method of getting this environmental message across.
