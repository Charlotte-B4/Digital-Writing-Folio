## Initial Thoughts (week 1) <a id="thoughts"></a>
Fiction and poetry are the writing forms I practise the most often. Imagery is a strength that I rely on, so I’m particularly interested in how I may be able to use digital tools to either enhance my uses of this, or to conjure imagery in an alternative way altogether. I expect the digital writing lab to be a challenge, but despite my focus on the broad and creative field of writing, I also have a logical side. Therefore, I expect to enjoy learning some of the more technical aspects of the digital writing lab as well as new creative ideas.
The class so far has made me consider the ways I’ve interacted with the digital world in my writing so far. I love collecting pretty notebooks, but I find myself using Word documents for the majority of my writing. This is especially the case for long projects, since I become overwhelmed by too much paper and have a nonstop need to chop, change around and reorganise my work. When I write analog it is usually the messy draft I am using to dump the ideas out of my brain rather than the main writing itself. I’m also a rigorous editor-as-I-go. I type fast, I delete fast. Writing on a computer helps me feel less tied down by each individual word and facilitates my style of writing practice in this regard.

I’ve also begun to look back more broadly on my roots in writing. I started writing as a child by turning A4 sheets of paper into my own picture books. When I learnt what a Word document was, however, my writing attention turned to that, and I began typing my picture books up and fiddling around with the design options and tacky Wordart. I would print the text out and draw the pictures by hand. Discovering Powerpoint sparked my interest even further, with its different animations and transitions to play around with, as well as Windows Live Movie Maker which I used to create little movies and animations—many of these combined text with screenshots I took from my favourite video games. Playing and creating with these software programs helped to spark my creativity in a big way growing up.

Before this week I believed I was completely new to the area of digital writing, but I’ve realised that my creative history suggests I have a natural interest in experimenting with technology to create and facilitate my storytelling.

## * Defining Electronic Literature (week 3 exercise) <a id="defining"></a>
500 - 750 words.
<strong>What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read? How are those elements meaningful? How are the works read differently from print literature? How is electronic literature different from print literature? What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?</strong>
The elements I read in these texts depended on the individual texts, them being so different from each other. Since "The Gathering Cloud" is a poem scape, I read passages of the piece multiple times in non-linear orders, trying to make sure I didn't miss anything. This felt fairly similar to how I would've read a print version of this piece, since I naturally read poetry in nonlinear ways. I think the digital quality is largely favoured in that it contributes to the piece's ironic theme of technology's environmental impact.

## Reflection on Learning Code, and the Coding Playground Task <a id="playground"></a>
<strong>How do you feel about coding now (vs week 1)?</strong><br>
Despite intial confusion with figuring out GitHub, I wasn't too worried about the coding component at the start of this course. I knew there would be a lot of work to be done, but I've always been pretty good at figuring out basic technology. I did take these past weeks to try and brute-force as much HTML and CSS knowledge as I could in a short amount of time, using the websites codecademy.com and w3schools.com. I enjoyed this since it offered a bit of a break from the intense fluid creativity required for the majority of my writing course. I also like languages, and this, learning a <em>coding language</em>, helped satiate some of the interest for me.

Moreover, while I did think of coding as a purely technical/logical field, I see now the creative potential of it. The Coding Playground task was instrumental in this since it let me flex some poetic creativety within these constraints, in a way I might not have otherwise. I see the poetntial of this area in letting me combine my creative and logic/language-based interests.

<strong>How has your hands-on engagement with interactive e-lit shifted the way you 'read' it? In what ways?</strong><br>
I feel much less confused by e-lit works now, I guess since I have more of an understanding of how they're constructed. The whole presentation of these works seem much more obtainable, and when I read them now I can focus much more on their writing and stories themselves, what they seek to do. Previously, I was more focused on the systems the digital writers used, and those felt almost otherworldly. In a way it has been like learning to read again, where you have to learn the system of words and how they fit together in a sentence before you can appreaciate how an author is using that system in a novel.

## Learning Twine <a id="twine"></a>
### Reflection (week 4)
My first impression of Twine is that it simply seems very handy for making hypertext literature. I already have an idea fo rmy final piece and a vague impression of how it might work using hyperlinks. What puts me off using Twine a bit is the default appearance of the program - I'm wondering whether coding from scratch would allow me the desired flexibility to achieve this vision of mine. Using Twine makes much more sense though.

<strone>Later reflection</strong><br>
I decided to go with Twine for my final project after searching the web for different pieces and examples of the program in use. I saw how much stylist freedom and depth it really offers. I also looked into Twine Sugarcube 2, and believe the default appearance of that version of the program achieves my desired look. I knew I wanted some basic graphics to go with my piece, and I decided to draw those digitally, using some photo references for the more complex images:

Examples: 
<strong>Reference 1 (a photo of the RMIT building 6 lift!)</strong> <strong>Image 1 (outside the life, passage: "Intro 5")</strong>

<strong>Reference 2 (a staircase photo, not my own, from: )</strong> <strong>Image 2 (level 4, passage: "Level 4-arrived")</strong>

Additionally, I made simple animated .gif images in a bid to add a sense of dynamics to the piece.
<strong>The outside control panel</strong> <strong>The inside control panel</strong>

I created these at the start of the piece's development, and had a great time working on them. It was a bit motivator to get my teeth into Twine and learn the program, seeing as I knew how I would be implementing the visual aesthetic of my piece.

I implemented image maps in my final digital piece. Notes on that can be found [here](./How-to-Use-a-Lift.md)

## Reflection on Previous Student’s Works <a id="previous"></a>
Though I came into this week having decided on an idea for my digital piece, looking at these three example works was creatively motivating. I loved the unsettling atmosphere of the piece ‘House on the Hill’, and though I won’t use Bitsy for my final piece, I wish to emulate a similar atmosphere, perhaps through music/sound effects too. Since I intend to use Twine, it was interesting to see how different the approaches were between the two pieces in that engine—one, titled ‘Stay Strong’, took a more story-based approach via a collage of dialogue elements, image, sound effects and occasional hyperlink-choices the reader could take. The other, ‘Snow Season’, transitioned more linearly (hyperlinks progressing the poem to its next screens), but it also made experimental use of text formatting—lots of different positioning, a small text size, and large scope background images—to heighten a sense of barrenness.

These last few weeks I’ve felt overwhelmed by the seemingly never-ending possibilities and directions that digital writing can take. I decided this week that I needed to reign in my mind, and made a concrete decision for what I’ll be pursuing for my final piece, something that will hopefully be satisfying enough to my creative ambitions but doable for my technical abilities and not overwhelming. The ‘Snow Season’ piece, in its effective simplicity, was also reassuring—I know now to not be so concerned by all the different features and accessories I’m potentially omitting, those skills I may not be able to shove into one single piece. It does not have to be a perfectly ambitious showcase, but can instead be more effective in its polished simplicity.

## * Reflection on Assessment 2 Feedback (week 8) <a id="feedback"></a>
Create a dot-point summary of where you are at and what you need to get done

## * Reflection on Workshop (week 9) <a id="workshop"></a>
<strong>Today we will continue work on the creative development of your piece. You will work in small groups to workshop your concept and prototype pages asking your peers to consider the same questions you considered yourself last week:

What are the themes and ideas the piece is exploring?
what drives the reader’s momentum through the piece?
how does the digital feed into this momentum?
what suggestions can you make for the reader experience?
Requirement for final folio (200 words minimum - can be done any time this week) Update your folio with a summary and reflection on the feedback you recieved and dot points for next steps with planned dates for doing it.</strong>

## * Author Website Reflection (week 9) <a id="author"></a>
