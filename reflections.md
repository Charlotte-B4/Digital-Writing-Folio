## Initial Thoughts (week 1) <a id="thoughts"></a>
Fiction and poetry are the writing forms I practise the most often. Imagery is a strength that I rely on, so I’m particularly interested in how I may be able to use digital tools to either enhance my uses of this, or to conjure imagery in an alternative way altogether. I expect the digital writing lab to be a challenge, but despite my focus on the broad and creative field of writing, I also have a logical side. Therefore, I expect to enjoy learning some of the more technical aspects of the digital writing lab as well as new creative ideas.
The class so far has made me consider the ways I’ve interacted with the digital world in my writing so far. I love collecting pretty notebooks, but I find myself using Word documents for the majority of my writing. This is especially the case for long projects, since I become overwhelmed by too much paper and have a nonstop need to chop, change around and reorganise my work. When I write analog it is usually the messy draft I am using to dump the ideas out of my brain rather than the main writing itself. I’m also a rigorous editor-as-I-go. I type fast, I delete fast. Writing on a computer helps me feel less tied down by each individual word and facilitates my style of writing practice in this regard.

I’ve also begun to look back more broadly on my roots in writing. I started writing as a child by turning A4 sheets of paper into my own picture books. When I learnt what a Word document was, however, my writing attention turned to that, and I began typing my picture books up and fiddling around with the design options and tacky Wordart. I would print the text out and draw the pictures by hand. Discovering Powerpoint sparked my interest even further, with its different animations and transitions to play around with, as well as Windows Live Movie Maker which I used to create little movies and animations—many of these combined text with screenshots I took from my favourite video games. Playing and creating with these software programs helped to spark my creativity in a big way growing up.

Before this week I believed I was completely new to the area of digital writing, but I’ve realised that my creative history suggests I have a natural interest in experimenting with technology to create and facilitate my storytelling.

## * Defining Electronic Literature (week 3 exercise) <a id="defining"></a>
<strong>Edit the readings.md page in your digital writing folio and add the following questions below. Answer these questions with reference to Week 1 & 2 readings (you can include anything from week 3 if you wish but W1&2 are probably most relevant). This passage should be 500 - 750 words.

What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?
How are those elements meaningful?
How are the works read differently from print literature?
How is electronic literature different from print literature?
What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?</strong>

## * Reflection on Learning Code, and the Coding Playground Task <a id="playground"></a>
<strong>On finishing classes with HTML/CSS/JS, and completing the Coding Playground task
CODING REFLECT QS

 Now that we have completed the technical HTML/CSS/JS portion of our learning, reflect also on these questions:


How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?
Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?</strong>

## * Learning Twine <a id="twine"></a>
### https://charlotte-b4.github.io/Learning-Twine/
### (screenshots here)
### Reflection (week 4)
<strong>passages - write about how I might use this</strong>

### Reflection (week 6)
<strong>Week 6 Exercise – Image styling, audio, and image maps within Twine
    - Repository is public and operational, the pieces are accessible to view
    - Reflection on the activity, can be in the readme as long as you make it clear that it is</strong>
-my image mapping is in my prototype for the final project

## Reflection on Previous Student’s Works <a id="previous"></a>
Though I came into this week having decided on an idea for my digital piece, looking at these three example works was creatively motivating. I loved the unsettling atmosphere of the piece ‘House on the Hill’, and though I won’t use Bitsy for my final piece, I wish to emulate a similar atmosphere, perhaps through music/sound effects too. Since I intend to use Twine, it was interesting to see how different the approaches were between the two pieces in that engine—one, titled ‘Stay Strong’, took a more story-based approach via a collage of dialogue elements, image, sound effects and occasional hyperlink-choices the reader could take. The other, ‘Snow Season’, transitioned more linearly (hyperlinks progressing the poem to its next screens), but it also made experimental use of text formatting—lots of different positioning, a small text size, and large scope background images—to heighten a sense of barrenness.

These last few weeks I’ve felt overwhelmed by the seemingly never-ending possibilities and directions that digital writing can take. I decided this week that I needed to reign in my mind, and made a concrete decision for what I’ll be pursuing for my final piece, something that will hopefully be satisfying enough to my creative ambitions but doable for my technical abilities and not overwhelming. The ‘Snow Season’ piece, in its effective simplicity, was also reassuring—I know now to not be so concerned by all the different features and accessories I’m potentially omitting, those skills I may not be able to shove into one single piece. It does not have to be a perfectly ambitious showcase, but can instead be more effective in its polished simplicity.

## * Reflection on Assessment 2 Feedback (week 8) <a id="feedback"></a>
Create a dot-point summary of where you are at and what you need to get done

## * Reflection on Workshop (week 9) <a id="workshop"></a>
<strong>Today we will continue work on the creative development of your piece. You will work in small groups to workshop your concept and prototype pages asking your peers to consider the same questions you considered yourself last week:

What are the themes and ideas the piece is exploring?
what drives the reader’s momentum through the piece?
how does the digital feed into this momentum?
what suggestions can you make for the reader experience?
Requirement for final folio (200 words minimum - can be done any time this week) Update your folio with a summary and reflection on the feedback you recieved and dot points for next steps with planned dates for doing it.</strong>

## * Author Website Reflection (week 9) <a id="author"></a>
