## Initial Thoughts (week 1) <a id="thoughts"></a>
Fiction and poetry are the writing forms I practise the most often. Imagery is a strength that I rely on, so I’m particularly interested in how I may be able to use digital tools to either enhance my uses of this, or to conjure imagery in an alternative way altogether. I expect the digital writing lab to be a challenge, but despite my focus on the broad and creative field of writing, I also have a logical side. Therefore, I expect to enjoy learning some of the more technical aspects of the digital writing lab as well as new creative ideas.
The class so far has made me consider the ways I’ve interacted with the digital world in my writing so far. I love collecting pretty notebooks, but I find myself using Word documents for the majority of my writing. This is especially the case for long projects, since I become overwhelmed by too much paper and have a nonstop need to chop, change around and reorganise my work. When I write analog it is usually the messy draft I am using to dump the ideas out of my brain rather than the main writing itself. I’m also a rigorous editor-as-I-go. I type fast, I delete fast. Writing on a computer helps me feel less tied down by each individual word and facilitates my style of writing practice in this regard.

I’ve also begun to look back more broadly on my roots in writing. I started writing as a child by turning A4 sheets of paper into my own picture books. When I learnt what a Word document was, however, my writing attention turned to that, and I began typing my picture books up and fiddling around with the design options and tacky Wordart. I would print the text out and draw the pictures by hand. Discovering Powerpoint sparked my interest even further, with its different animations and transitions to play around with, as well as Windows Live Movie Maker which I used to create little movies and animations—many of these combined text with screenshots I took from my favourite video games. Playing and creating with these software programs helped to spark my creativity in a big way growing up.

Before this week I believed I was completely new to the area of digital writing, but I’ve realised that my creative history suggests I have a natural interest in experimenting with technology to create and facilitate my storytelling.

## Defining Electronic Literature (week 3 exercise) <a id="defining"></a>
The elements I read in these texts depended on the individual texts, them being so different from each other. 

"First Draft of the Revolution" by Emily Short and Liza Daly is the clearest example of this, since it uses hyperlinks which allow the reader to edit the text of the letters that they, from the perspective of the main character, are writing. This is a very meaningful digital element of the piece, which provides subtle insight into the characters and their dynamics in a psychologically fascinating way. The ability adds a new layer to the idea that a story should be shown, not told, in a way that may not be as effective in a traditional narrative.

The piece “Taroko Gorge” by Nick Monfort s a poetry generator that produces lines down the page continuously. It acts like a conveyor belt, cycling lines up until they are out of existence. The poem emulates a river with the way words flow fluidly and unpredictably. The reconstruction of lines also shows the fluid way everything is connected. The tools used for this poem appear similar to the tools many physical poems use, for example, onomatopoeia is often used in attempt to recreate and emulate a sound, and attempt to place the reader into the experience of the poem itself. Therefore, I see Monfort’s poem like traditional poem in this sense, but one which uses the new technology available to us to manifest this in a new and innovative way. 

Since "The Gathering Cloud" by JR Carpenter is a poem scape, I read passages of the piece multiple times in non-linear orders, trying to make sure I didn't miss anything. More elements, lines of writing and images, are added to the page the longer the reader stays on it. This felt fairly similar to how I would've read a print version of this piece, since I naturally read poetry in nonlinear ways. I think the digital quality is largely favoured in that it contributes to the piece's ironic theme of technology's environmental impact. I found out after reading this piece that it is a hybrid work and also has a print version, which made sense considering these thoughts. 

“Shade” by Andrew Plotkin acts like a traditional choose-your-own-adventure style text, but the digital quality allows much more choice and flexibility from the reader than would otherwise be possible. The reader feels as if they are able to physically move through the space and control it in a way, shifting their own position in the story to dictate the directions the story takes, the order the story progresses, and its eventual ending.

The key difference between print and digital literature I’ve realised so far is the text's ability to not just progress, but to shift and change in many different ways. Where Carpenter and Monfort’s poems move and change physically on the screen as a part of their viewing experience of the digital format, Plotkin and Short’s pieces allow the reader to shift and dictate the story themselves.

## Reflection on Learning Code, and the Coding Playground Task <a id="playground"></a>
<strong>How do you feel about coding now (vs week 1)?</strong><br>
Despite intial confusion with figuring out GitHub, I wasn't too worried about the coding component at the start of this course. I knew there would be a lot of work to be done, but I've always been pretty good at figuring out basic technology. I did take these past weeks to try and brute-force as much HTML and CSS knowledge as I could in a short amount of time, using the websites codecademy.com and w3schools.com. I enjoyed this since it offered a bit of a break from the intense fluid creativity required for the majority of my writing course. I also like languages, and this, learning a <em>coding language</em>, helped satiate some of the interest for me.

Moreover, while I did think of coding as a purely technical/logical field, I see now the creative potential of it. The Coding Playground task was instrumental in this since it let me flex some poetic creativety within these constraints, in a way I might not have otherwise. I see the poetntial of this area in letting me combine my creative and logic/language-based interests.

<strong>How has your hands-on engagement with interactive e-lit shifted the way you 'read' it? In what ways?</strong><br>
I feel much less confused by e-lit works now, I guess since I have more of an understanding of how they're constructed. The whole presentation of these works seem much more obtainable, and when I read them now I can focus much more on their writing and stories themselves, what they seek to do. Previously, I was more focused on the systems the digital writers used, and those felt almost otherworldly. In a way it has been like learning to read again, where you have to learn the system of words and how they fit together in a sentence before you can appreaciate how an author is using that system in a novel.

## Learning Twine <a id="twine"></a>
### Reflection (week 4)
My first impression of Twine is that it simply seems very handy for making hypertext literature. I already have an idea fo rmy final piece and a vague impression of how it might work using hyperlinks. What puts me off using Twine a bit is the default appearance of the program - I'm wondering whether coding from scratch would allow me the desired flexibility to achieve this vision of mine. Using Twine makes much more sense though.

<strone>Later reflection</strong><br>
I decided to go with Twine for my final project after searching the web for different pieces and examples of the program in use. I saw how much stylist freedom and depth it really offers. I also looked into Twine Sugarcube 2, and believe the default appearance of that version of the program achieves my desired look. I knew I wanted some basic graphics to go with my piece, and I decided to draw those digitally, using some photo references for the more complex images:

Examples: 
<strong>Reference 1 (a photo of the RMIT building 6 lift!)</strong> <strong>Image 1 (outside the life, passage: "Intro 5")</strong>

<strong>Reference 2 (a staircase photo, not my own, from: )</strong> <strong>Image 2 (level 4, passage: "Level 4-arrived")</strong>

Additionally, I made simple animated .gif images in a bid to add a sense of dynamics to the piece.
<strong>The outside control panel</strong> <strong>The inside control panel</strong>

I created these at the start of the piece's development, and had a great time working on them. It was a bit motivator to get my teeth into Twine and learn the program, seeing as I knew how I would be implementing the visual aesthetic of my piece.

I implemented image maps in my final digital piece. Notes on that can be found [here](./How-to-Use-a-Lift.md)

## Reflection on Previous Student’s Works (week 6) <a id="previous"></a>
Though I came into this week having decided on an idea for my digital piece, looking at these three example works was creatively motivating. I loved the unsettling atmosphere of the piece ‘House on the Hill’, and though I won’t use Bitsy for my final piece, I wish to emulate a similar atmosphere, perhaps through music/sound effects too. Since I intend to use Twine, it was interesting to see how different the approaches were between the two pieces in that engine—one, titled ‘Stay Strong’, took a more story-based approach via a collage of dialogue elements, image, sound effects and occasional hyperlink-choices the reader could take. The other, ‘Snow Season’, transitioned more linearly (hyperlinks progressing the poem to its next screens), but it also made experimental use of text formatting—lots of different positioning, a small text size, and large scope background images—to heighten a sense of barrenness.

These last few weeks I’ve felt overwhelmed by the seemingly never-ending possibilities and directions that digital writing can take. I decided this week that I needed to reign in my mind, and made a concrete decision for what I’ll be pursuing for my final piece, something that will hopefully be satisfying enough to my creative ambitions but doable for my technical abilities and not overwhelming. The ‘Snow Season’ piece, in its effective simplicity, was also reassuring—I know now to not be so concerned by all the different features and accessories I’m potentially omitting, those skills I may not be able to shove into one single piece. It does not have to be a perfectly ambitious showcase, but can instead be more effective in its polished simplicity.

## Reflection on Assessment 2 Feedback + Where I'll Go From Here (week 8)<a id="feedback"></a>

(A reminder that I did my presentation remotely)

I'm the kind of worker who likes to focus on one things at a time, and go deep into that before progressing to the next stage. Since my styling and code was a big hurdle, I chose to figure most of htat out first. Now that the styling and Twine code is less of a concern, I know now it’s time to delve fully into the writing portion of the piece. For the time being, I have started writing my text physically in a notebook, and then transferring it into my word document table/story map while polishing the text. 

It feels strange to have the actual writing be the last focus of a writing class, but I’ve mapped out how the piece will progress enough in my head to the point that I believe I’ll be able to place the text into my story map without issue. I will work to refine the worldbuilding and narrative in the coming weeks.

## Reflection on Workshopping (week 9) <a id="workshop"></a>
The version of my piece I workshopped in class introduces the framework of the piece, the technological space of traversing the lift as the reader, and the media usage of the visuals and audio. I also have a basic outline of the story’s plot, but like in my feedback reflection, my priority now is on developing the writing itself. Workshoppers found the piece entertaining to read and progress through, mainly due to the lift functionality that lets them choose the order they progress through the tower. In that sense, I believe this digital function is what drives the momentum of my piece.

This will help develop the theme of my piece, that being social anxiety as told via one’s progress through a surrealist location. At this stage, I intend for the writing to have a more poetic/figurative style, to add to the surrealist sense I wish to convey. The rest of my story will be mapped out outside of the Twine system, but it will be important to make sure the writing works in tandem with the digital space, and the reader’s momentum and engagement with the piece isn’t blocked at any point. Adding to this, it will also be important to keep the lengths of the main, poetic passages consistent.

## Author Website Reflection (week 9) <a id="author"></a>
The idea of putting myself out there as a writer is daunting, especially as someone who doesn't use social media, but it's good to know I have a basic website I can use to refer to my work in the future. It's good to know I have the skills to upkeep it myself in the future.
